There are a bunch of people who have expressed interest in how to heat small spaces. So for example, there's the problem of keeping animal water warm enough to not ice over off-grid and heating a tiny home with a wood stove or electric heat. And in general, there seems to be an important topic around estimating the energy requirements for heating or cooling buildings in small spaces in an era when we might consider various heat sources from wood to propane to electric. And there are specific examples around the off-grid water heating and say a goat shed heating. What I'm imagining is using the water heating and the goat shed heating as practical examples and making connections to other similar problems with say tiny homes and using this as a basis for discussing heat flow and insulation. And then in the course of the workshop setting up an example where we have relatively small boxes that we insulate or not and add an incandescent bulb inside or not and measure the temperature outside and inside and look at the effects of these things and maybe include a fan and even potentially figure out cooling of collected some notes below related to the goat shed problem. I'd like to summarize all of these ideas into a nice concise description of a workshop if you could help me.

I'd like to include the notion of 'heat pumps', and understanding them -- perhaps with the idea that we could make our own small version.



To establish a basic model for heat flow in the goat shed, begin with the fundamental principle governing steady-state conductive heat loss through the building envelope: the rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference between the interior and exterior, the surface area exposed to that difference, and the thermal transmittance of the materials.

The standard engineering formula for conductive heat loss (often termed transmission or fabric heat loss) is:

**Q = U × A × ΔT**

where:
- **Q** is the heat loss rate (in watts [W] or BTU per hour, depending on units preferred),
- **U** is the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) of the building element (in W/(m²·K) or BTU/(h·ft²·°F)),
- **A** is the surface area of that element (in m² or ft²),
- **ΔT** is the temperature difference (T_inside - T_outside) (in °C/K or °F).

The U-value represents how readily heat passes through a wall, roof, floor, door, or other surface; it is the reciprocal of the total thermal resistance (R-value) of the assembly: **U = 1 / R_total**, where R_total sums the resistances of all layers (including air films on inner and outer surfaces).

### Key Variables for a Basic Model
The primary variables to incorporate at the outset are:
- **ΔT** (temperature delta): Measure or assume steady indoor target temperature (e.g., 5–15 °C for goats, depending on breed, age, and health needs) minus outdoor temperature. Use logged data from your current on-grid setup to establish realistic indoor values under heat lamp operation.
- **A** (surface area): Calculate separately for each envelope component:
  - Walls (typically the largest contributor),
  - Roof/ceiling,
  - Floor (often lower loss if on ground, but include if raised or uninsulated),
  - Doors/windows (high U-values if uninsulated).
  Exclude floor-ground contact initially if the shed rests directly on earth, as ground temperature is more stable than air temperature; approximate ground loss separately if needed.
- **U** (or equivalent R-value): Assign approximate U-values based on construction. For a typical uninsulated or lightly insulated shed:
  - Uninsulated metal/wood walls: U ≈ 5–7 W/(m²·K),
  - Insulated walls (e.g., fiberglass batts): U ≈ 0.3–0.6 W/(m²·K),
  - Roof: Often higher loss; adjust for any existing or proposed insulation.
  Look up material-specific R-values (e.g., fiberglass ≈ R-3.5 per inch) and compute composite U for each assembly.

### Additional Relevant Variables
For a more complete yet still introductory model suitable for a workshop:
- **Infiltration/ventilation heat loss**: Air exchange carries significant heat away. Approximate as **Q_vent = ρ × c_p × V × ACH × ΔT**, where ρ is air density (≈1.2 kg/m³), c_p is specific heat of air (≈1000 J/(kg·K)), V is shed volume (m³), and ACH is air changes per hour (0.5–2 for a reasonably sealed shed; higher with doors/gaps). This often equals or exceeds conductive loss in small, leaky structures.
- **Internal heat gains**: From the goats themselves (metabolic heat, roughly 50–150 W per adult goat depending on size and activity) plus any supplemental sources. In steady state, required heating input equals total losses minus gains.
- **Wind effects**: Increase effective U for exterior surfaces (especially walls/roof) by enhancing convective heat transfer; a simple adjustment multiplies exterior surface resistance by a wind factor.
- **Ground losses**: If relevant, use a reduced ΔT based on average soil temperature rather than air temperature.

### Practical Starting Point for Modeling
1. Measure or estimate shed dimensions to compute areas (A) for walls, roof, etc.
2. Select a design indoor temperature and record outdoor conditions (or use historical data for your location in Watertown, MA).
3. Assign initial U-values to each surface (conservative estimates for uninsulated: walls/roof ≈ 4–6 W/(m²·K); improve with proposed insulation).
4. Compute Q_conduction = Σ (U_i × A_i × ΔT) across all surfaces.
5. Add Q_infiltration ≈ 0.33 × V × ACH × ΔT (in watts, with ACH ≈ 1 for moderate sealing).
6. Compare total Q to current heat lamp output (from on-grid measurements) to validate the baseline.

This approach uses steady-state assumptions (constant temperatures, no thermal mass effects) and aligns with Newton's law of cooling in its proportional dependence on ΔT. It provides intuition for how insulation (higher R, lower U) and reduced air leakage dramatically cut required heating power.

For the workshop, this model can be implemented in a simple spreadsheet or basic code to allow participants to vary insulation levels and observe impacts on heat loss. If desired, we can refine it further with specific shed dimensions or typical goat thermal requirements.
