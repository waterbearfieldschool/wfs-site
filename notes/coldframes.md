In the Cold Frame's workshop, we imagine finding used windows, testing them for lead, making sure that they're lead-free, any paint is lead-free, and then using inexpensive woodworking techniques, build a cold frame, useful for season extension, growing extension, will use basic hand tools and techniques, and participants can go home with the components of a cold frame that they can easily assemble on site at home.
