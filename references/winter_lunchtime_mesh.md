Winter Lunchtime Mesh Radio Workshop

Eventbrite Copy

Event Title

Mesh Radio (Winter Lunchtime Edition)
Hands-on communication beyond the internet

⸻

Short Description

A focused, outdoor winter workshop held during the warmest part of the day.

Learn how small radios can form decentralized communication networks without relying on cellular service or the internet. We’ll explore how mesh radios work, how messages move through the network, and what it takes to deploy them in real-world conditions.

No prior experience required.

Full Description

Most modern communication depends on distant infrastructure we rarely see. Mesh radio flips that model.

This winter lunchtime workshop is a compact, hands-on introduction to decentralized radio communication, held outdoors during the warmest part of the day. In a small group setting (max 6 people), we’ll use real radios to build a simple mesh network and watch how messages move from device to device.

Cold weather isn’t an obstacle here. It’s part of the lesson. Winter conditions make questions of power, placement, and reliability more visible and more real.

The emphasis is on understanding how the system behaves, not on memorizing radio theory.

⸻

We’ll explore:
	•	What mesh radio is and how it differs from cellular and Wi-Fi
	•	How messages hop between radios in a mesh network
	•	The role of antennas, placement, and terrain
	•	Power requirements for handheld radios vs fixed repeaters
	•	Real-world use cases: farms, neighborhoods, events, and field work

⸻

You’ll leave with:
	•	A clear mental model of how mesh networks function
	•	Experience sending messages across a live mesh
	•	Practical insight into deploying radios in the field
	•	Better questions about range, reliability, and power

Gentle Rationale for Taking Both Workshops

(Use this on both Eventbrite pages or your website)

You can include a small section titled:

How These Workshops Fit Together

Off-grid power and mesh radio are deeply connected systems.

Radios don’t exist in isolation. They need energy to function, and the way that energy is generated, stored, and managed shapes how reliable a radio network can be.

In the Off-Grid Power workshop, we explore how electricity is generated, stored, and measured at small scales.
In the Mesh Radio workshop, we explore how information moves through decentralized networks.

Taken together, these workshops reveal the full loop:
	•	Solar panels and batteries power radios and repeaters
	•	Radios can be used to monitor remote solar and energy infrastructure
	•	Reliable communication depends on realistic energy planning

Each workshop stands on its own, but many participants find that taking both helps the concepts click into place more fully.

That’s it. No upsell, no funnel language. Just systems thinking stated plainly.

Optional One-Line Cross-Links (Highly Recommended)

Add one line near the bottom of each Eventbrite page.

Interested in how radios, sensors, and repeaters are powered off-grid? See our Winter Lunchtime Mesh Radio workshop.

On the Mesh Radio Workshop:

Curious how radios are powered and how to design reliable solar-powered repeaters? See our Winter Lunchtime Off-Grid Power workshop.

These lines do quiet, effective work.

Why This Pairing Is Especially Strong in Winter

You don’t need to say this explicitly, but it’s true:
	•	Winter exposes power constraints
	•	Cold reveals battery behavior
	•	Short days make solar tradeoffs visible
	•	Radios make invisible infrastructure tangible

Participants feel like they’re learning something real, not hypothetical.

⸻

If you’d like, next we can:
	•	Design a third “capstone” lunchtime workshop that combines both (solar-powered mesh node)
	•	Create a simple visual diagram showing power → radio → monitoring
	•	Or sketch a 4–6 week winter lunchtime arc that feels complete without being heavy

This is shaping into a very coherent offering.
