I'd like to create a journal entry that is an update on the Grass-Nomads project, and once I create that journal entry, it will be linked as an update on the Grass-Nomads project page. The update is that I've been trying to figure out a nice way of using a lithium-iron phosphate battery, which is likely going to do better in the cold temperatures of winter in New Mexico than lithium-ion or lead acid, and what I'd found was some nice integrated circuits that will charge a single cell lithium-iron phosphate battery. I'd also found a relatively inexpensive single-cell lithium-iron phosphate battery of 7,000 milliamp hour capacity, which seems appropriate for our setup, in order to make sure that it is enough capacity for our project, I went back and made careful measurements of the power draw of the satellite modem transmitter system, including the new submersible pressure-based depth sensor, both during satellite transmission and during its sleep mode, and what I found was that after the satellite modem has been put in sleep mode, the overall system seems to sleep at around 2 milliamps, which is likely the combined current draw of chip, which is supplying 5 volts from the 3.2-volt nominal single-cell lithium-iron phosphate to the 5-volt satellite modem, which needs to be powered even while asleep, as well as the sleep current of the satellite modem itself, and a 2 milliamp draw seems compatible with a resilient system that is powered by solar and needs to persist even during periods of cloudy weather. I'm currently measuring battery drain overnight when using the system without any solar charging to verify that it is not a very large draw on the battery, and it seems to be going well, and my current next step is to redesign slightly the overall circuit to integrate this new solar charging chip and boost chip. There are existing products from Adafruit that use these chips, but they are currently configured for a lithium-ion battery, and also the boost chip that seems most appropriate is not combined with the solar charging chip that I have landed upon as the optimal one. So I think I need to design a new board that combines the chips that I'm interested in the right way. I also am considering redesigning the circuitry for measuring the submersible probe, which is a 4 to 20 milliamp current loop-based sensor, and while I am assessing the battery drain, I might look into that redesign.
