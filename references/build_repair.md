I'm hoping to create an ongoing workshop that is a sort of build and repair meetup that might start to curate a particular group of individuals who are interested to develop repair and fabrication skills relevant to small farms and small scale food production, including things like rainwater capture and welding and carpentry and making hoop houses and monitoring temperature and fixing electronics and making useful tools on the local site.
