Uh, two workshop ideas to add into the mix are the cardboard fabrication workshop using the nibbler and plastic fasteners and plastic cutting tools that's safe for kids and still interesting for adults, and coming up with some interesting designs for both kids and adults to make that way. The nibbler is a device that is an attachment to a drill and we would be using a battery or a solar panel directly to power the nibbler. It's operated by a foot pedal and it kind of works almost like a mini table saw but with completely safe with cardboard and we would set that up in a park and we'd be able to do things like that. The other workshop is a quote-unquote printing press workshop where we use or even make our own little blocks and print on paper various designs. Maybe we would carve something out of wood as a kind of a wood carving to then print out. That's another workshop design.
