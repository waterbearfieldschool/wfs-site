Some quick edits on the mesh radio description. After mesh radio flips that model, never mind. Omit the sentence, each device can act as both an end point and a relay. Omit the bullet point, power requirements. Edit the bullet point, working with affordable hardware, et cetera, to working with affordable hardware, append protests to the end of the last bullet point. Under workshop details, put cost above equipment, make it $65 per person. Under equipment, say, radios provided for use during the workshop. And in parentheses, available for purchase, either also available for purchase and parentheses.
