Most modern communication depends on distant infrastructure we rarely see and can't access. Mesh radio flips that model.

This winter lunchtime workshop is a compact, hands-on introduction to decentralized radio communication, held outdoors during the warmest part of the day. In a small group setting (max 6 participants), we'll use real radios to build a simple mesh network, and watch how messages move from device to device. We'll learn the basics of setting up repeaters in useful locations, enabling participants to begin to develop resilient, secure communications networks in their own neighborhoods (and beyond).

## Background

Recently developed, open source radio projects now allow people to communicate over several miles, with minimal power, using low-cost hardware that doesn't require a special license. When multiple devices form a mesh network, messages automatically hop from node to node, extending range far beyond what a single radio could achieve. Many people are now using these radio technologies to develop resilient local networks that continue to operate even when the cellular network, internet, or grid are down or unavailable.
