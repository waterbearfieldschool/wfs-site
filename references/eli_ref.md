Overview
Combine 3D printing with lost-wax investment casting techniques!
This course meets 3 times per class session. Please check the Agenda above for the dates included in each session. By purchasing a ticket, you are committing to attend all meetings included in that session. The title of the Agenda page will indicate which ticket to purchase for that session.
Instructor - Eli West
Eli is a visual artist and metalsmith. He enjoys casting with bronze, making small sculptures, forming sheet metal into functional objects, and exploring patinas and textures on metal. He has a keen interest in geography and biology and tries to highlight concepts from both disciplines in his art.



Class Description
In this three day class, we’ll dive into the worlds of 3D printing and casting. We’ll discuss how to make and find 3D files online, then 3D print them in PLA filament and on a Form 3 resin printer. On days two and three, we’ll prepare our objects with wax sprues, mix investment in flasks with our objects, run an overnight burnout in a kiln, and cast them in ancient bronze.

Students will take home their cast bronze objects, which could include rings, animals, topographical features, miniature scenes, or anything you can dream up! This class is intended for everyone - from folks without 3D printing or casting experience, to people with more experience in either discipline.



Material Fee
The materials fee for this class is $30. This is separate from the ticket price and is to reimburse the instructor for any tools or materials used in this class. This will be paid once, directly to the instructor at the start of the first class meeting. This instructor accepts payments in cash or through Venmo.
