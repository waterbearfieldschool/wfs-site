I'd like to keep the slideshow on the main landing page; for the 'Outdoor Exploration and Maker Group' rectangle, I'd like the title to be 'Current Workshops';  retain 'Greater Boston Area * Winter 2026'; keep the 'bubbles' and the blurb below.  Then drop the remaining rectangles, and replace with the current content of the src/workshops page.  I'd then like to repeat this structure below that, with an 'Upcoming Workshops' rectangle, no bubbles, and a blurb saying 'Below are some workshops we are considering offering soon.  If you'd be interested to attend (or teach!) any of them -- or have an idea for another workshop!  please let us know at info@waterbearfieldschool.org. And then (for now) list the same workshops as src/workshops.  After we accomplish the layout for this, I will sort / add / subtract workshops content for each category.  In the 'navigatation' section on the left, it would be nice to have links to 'current workshops' and 'upcoming workshops', which scroll us to that part of the landing page. Please use AskUserQuestion to clarify any questions about this revision, and present me with a detailed plan before implementing these changes.
