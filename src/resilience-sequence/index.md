## The Resilience Sequence

A 4-week cohort program that takes you through multiple resilience foundations in a structured learning sequence. Each season features different workshops, so you can return and build new skills year-round.

### How It Works

The Resilience Sequence runs four times a year, with each season featuring a different combination of workshops:

- **Week 1: Energy** - Learn to generate and store power independently
- **Week 2: Climate** - Master heating, cooling, and air quality
- **Week 3: Communication** - Build infrastructure-free communication networks
- **Week 4: Fabrication/Transport** - Create and repair physical systems

### Why Take the Sequence?

Taking workshops together as a cohort creates connections between skills and between participants. You'll see how energy systems power communication devices, how fabrication skills enable custom solutions, and how these capabilities compound into real resilience.

The bundle also saves money compared to taking workshops individually.

### Pricing

| Option | Price |
|--------|-------|
| Full Sequence (4 workshops) | $275 |
| Early Bird (3+ weeks ahead) | $250 |
| Individual workshops | ~$80 each ($320 total) |

### Seasonal Schedule

Each season features different workshops, allowing you to build a complete skill set over time:

| Season | Energy | Climate | Communication | Making |
|--------|--------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Winter 2026** | Off-Grid Power | Air Filtration | Mesh Radio | Bike Trailers |
| **Spring 2026** | Solar Charging | CO2 Monitoring | GMRS Basics | Welding Intro |
| **Summer 2026** | Battery Basics | Passive Cooling | Ham Radio Intro | Sandcasting |
| **Fall 2026** | Gravity Storage | Biochar Filters | SDR Listening | E-Bike Conversion |

### Completion Credentials
