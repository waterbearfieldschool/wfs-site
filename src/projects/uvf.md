## Overview

This project aims to develop a low-cost UV spectrophotometer for assessing water filter effectiveness and measuring dissolved organic matter in drinking water.

Commercial UV spectrophotometers used for water testing typically cost over $2,000. Our goal is to build a working prototype costing under $100 in parts that can be constructed and used in community workshop settings.

## Why UV254?

UV absorbance at 254nm wavelength is a reliable indicator of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water. This measurement is particularly useful for:

- Testing the effectiveness of biochar and activated carbon water filters
- Monitoring filter breakthrough (when filters need replacement)
- Assessing water quality without expensive laboratory tests

## The Science

Research by Dr. Josh Kearns and colleagues has shown that UV254 measurement can serve as a surrogate for detecting harder-to-measure contaminants. Some contaminants adsorb more easily to filters than others - by tracking the easier-to-measure dissolved organic matter, we can infer when more stubborn contaminants might be breaking through.

## Current Development

We're building on published DIY spectrophotometer designs, developing custom PCBs for the UV LED emitter and photodetector, and testing against commercial instruments to validate accuracy.
