## Overview

This project develops an easy-to-assemble cart for transporting standard vegetable containers on small farms, created in collaboration with the Young Farmer Network.

## The Problem with Commercial Carts

Typical garden carts are:
- Expensive (often $500+)
- Too small for multiple crates
- Unnecessarily heavy wood construction
- Too narrow to straddle 30" vegetable beds

## Our Design

The DIY crate cart addresses all these issues:
- **Cost**: Approximately $120 in materials (less than 1/3 commercial price)
- **Capacity**: Holds 4-8 standard farm crates
- **Construction**: Lightweight electrical conduit frame
- **Width**: Straddles common 30" vegetable beds

## Materials

- Recycled 26" bicycle wheels
- 1/2" and 3/4" electrical conduit
- Welded wire fencing
- Custom laser-cut dropouts (open source design)
- U-bolts and hardware

## Skills You'll Learn

Building a crate cart teaches transferable skills for farm infrastructure:
- Working with metal tubing
- Bending and cutting conduit
- Fabricating small metal parts
- Skills applicable to low tunnels, hoop houses, and chicken coops
