## Overview

This project explores DIY water filtration systems using biochar, based on the pioneering work of Dr. Josh Kearns and Aqueous Solutions. Biochar filters offer a locally-producible alternative to commercial activated carbon for removing contaminants from drinking water.

## Why Biochar?

Activated carbon filters effectively remove contaminants but are costly and require industrial production. Research over the last decade shows that biochar, when produced at sufficiently high temperatures, can serve as an effective replacement.

Key advantages of biochar filters:
- Can be produced from agricultural waste
- Made using equipment built from widely-available materials
- Significantly lower cost than commercial alternatives
- Designs range from 300 to 2000+ liters per day capacity

## The Challenge of Testing

Laboratory testing for water contaminants can cost $100+ per sample. Kearns et al. developed lower-cost testing methods using UV spectrophotometry to assess filter effectiveness - which connects to our UV254 Spectrophotometer project.

## Resources

Aqueous Solutions provides detailed manuals for building biochar water filtration systems in multiple languages, with designs for both household and community-scale use.
