## Overview

This project develops a satellite modem-based water level monitoring system for remote ranch water storage tanks, created in collaboration with Grass Nomads LLC and supported by the LOR Foundation.

## The Challenge

Ojo Feliz Ranch in New Mexico spans 127,000 acres with over 30 miles of pipeline and dozens of wells, drinkers, and storage tanks. Checking water levels in remote storage tanks can add dozens of miles and many hours to the work week. Remote monitoring saves time, vehicle wear, and water - while enabling better range management through higher herd density.

## The Solution

Because of the remote location and uncertain cellular coverage, we developed a satellite modem-based system featuring:

- **LoRa sensor nodes** with ultrasonic depth sensors mounted on tanks
- **LoRa-to-satellite gateway** relaying data via Iridium satellite network
- **Online database** accessible via internet or phone from anywhere

## Hardware Components

The system uses off-the-shelf components including:
- Rockblock 9602 Satellite Modem
- Maxbotix ultrasonic water sensors
- Feather M0 LoRa microcontrollers
- Solar panels and battery charging circuits
