## Overview

This project uses CO2 monitors as tracer gas instruments to assess indoor ventilation rates and air quality. Better ventilation means healthier indoor spaces.

## Why CO2?

Since most indoor CO2 comes from human exhalation, measuring CO2 levels tells us how much of the air we're breathing has been exhaled by others - the "rebreathe fraction." This is directly relevant to airborne disease transmission.

- Outdoor CO2: ~420 ppm
- Well-ventilated indoor: under 800 ppm
- Poorly ventilated: 1000+ ppm

## The Tracer Gas Method

Beyond simple monitoring, CO2 can be used as a "tracer gas" to measure air changes per hour (ACH):

1. Inject a known amount of CO2 into a room
2. Monitor the decay rate as ventilation replaces the air
3. Calculate ACH from the decay curve

This gives a quantitative measure of ventilation quality.

## Practical Applications

- Assessing classroom ventilation
- Evaluating workspace air quality
- Testing the effectiveness of ventilation improvements
- Informing decisions about air purifier placement
