## Overview

This project documents the Corsi-Rosenthal box DIY air purifier design - a low-cost, highly effective approach to improving indoor air quality that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic from collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

## The Design

The Corsi-Rosenthal box uses readily available materials:

- **Four 20" MERV-13 filters** forming the sides of a cube
- **A 20" box fan** on top, pulling air through the filters
- **Cardboard** sealing the bottom

Total cost: approximately **$120-200 USD**, with no special tools required.

## How It Works

MERV-13 filters can remove about 85% of virus-laden particles from air. These devices deliver approximately 600 cubic feet per minute of filtered air to a room. For medium-sized rooms, one to three boxes can boost air changes per hour (ACH) to the 6 ACH minimum recommended by the Harvard School of Public Health.

## Why It Matters

Improving indoor ventilation is crucial for reducing airborne pathogen transmission. For comparison:
- Typical home rooms: less than 1 ACH
- School classrooms (ASHRAE standard): ~3 ACH
- Hospital patient rooms: 6 ACH
- Hospital airborne isolation rooms: 12+ ACH

## Resources Available

The project page includes:
- Step-by-step build instructions
- Performance testing methodology
- Placement recommendations
- Safety considerations for filter handling
