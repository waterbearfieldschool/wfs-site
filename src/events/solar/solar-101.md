Even though it was cloudy and a bit rainy, we had a great time at the 'Solar 101' workshop.  Greg Nelson (our friend via [OtherWise](https://otherwise.one/)), Mike Beach (our friend via [Artisan's Asylum](https://www.artisansasylum.com/)), and some other local folks helped make it a very productive and fun gathering!

Although we weren't able to get any useful current from the panels on such a cloudy day, we used batteries to drive a bunch of motors (toy wheels, drills, greenhouse side rollers), and learned a bit about current, voltage, and power requirements for various DC applications.
