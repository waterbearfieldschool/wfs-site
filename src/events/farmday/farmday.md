We'll have a booth at [Farm Day](https://communityfarms.org/calendar/event/farm-day-2025#!prettyPhoto) at [Waltham Fields Community Farm](https://communityfarms.org/) in Waltham, MA.  

We're still working on demos and games, but some items on our list are:
- the basics of a small solar-powered system
- how to cheaply measure voltage and current for DC appliances
- off-grid radios you can use with your phone
- water level and water quality sensors
- hand tools
- a bike trailer and garden cart design
- and more!

Come stop by and say hello!
