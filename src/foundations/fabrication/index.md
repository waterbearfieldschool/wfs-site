## Fabrication: How do we make and repair things?

When something breaks, can you fix it? When you need a custom part, can you make it? What does it take to work with metal, cast parts, or build tools?

Our fabrication workshops teach fundamental making and repair skills. Learn to weld, cast metal, and work with your hands to create and fix things. These are the skills that let you maintain equipment, build custom solutions, and participate in a maker community.

### Why This Matters

The ability to make and repair is becoming rare—and increasingly valuable. When you can weld a broken bracket, cast a replacement part, or fabricate a custom solution, you're not dependent on supply chains or service technicians. Fabrication skills are force multipliers for all other resilience work.
