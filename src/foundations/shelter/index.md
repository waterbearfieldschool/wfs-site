## Shelter: How do we build and maintain structures?

Can you repair your own home? Build a shed, a cold frame, a tiny house? What structural principles do you need to understand to create safe, durable buildings?

Our shelter workshops teach fundamental carpentry and construction skills through practical projects. Learn framing principles by building bike trailers, understand joinery through shed construction, and develop the confidence to tackle building projects of increasing complexity.

### Why This Matters

Building skills are increasingly rare, but endlessly useful. Understanding how structures work—loads, joints, materials—lets you maintain your home, build outbuildings, and create the infrastructure that supports other resilience activities. A well-built shed can house your workshop; a cold frame extends your growing season; a bike trailer expands your transportation options.
