## Air: How do we monitor and improve air quality?

Indoor air quality affects our health more than most people realize. From CO2 buildup indicating poor ventilation to particulates from smoke and pollution, understanding what's in the air we breathe is the first step to improving it.

Our air workshops teach practical approaches to monitoring and filtering indoor air. Build your own CO2 monitors to know when to ventilate, and construct effective air purifiers for a fraction of commercial costs.

### Why This Matters

We spend most of our time indoors, breathing air that can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air. High CO2 levels indicate poor ventilation and correlate with decreased cognitive function. Particulate matter from cooking, wildfires, and outdoor pollution accumulates indoors without proper filtration.
