## Heating/Cooling: How do we stay comfortable off-grid?

How do you stay warm when the power's out? Cool when it's 100 degrees? Understanding heat transfer and low-energy heating and cooling strategies is essential for off-grid resilience.

Our heating/cooling workshops teach practical approaches to thermal comfort without relying on the grid. Learn to calculate heat loss, size heating systems appropriately, and explore efficient technologies for small spaces.

### Why This Matters

Heating and cooling consume enormous amounts of energy—and fail exactly when you need them most, during extreme weather. Understanding passive solar design, thermal mass, and efficient heating lets you stay comfortable with minimal energy.
