## Transport: How do we move people and goods?

How do you get around when gas is scarce or roads are blocked? How do you haul supplies, tools, or materials without a truck? What does resilient transportation look like?

Our transport workshops focus on human-scale solutions—bikes, cargo trailers, and electric assist systems. Learn to build trailers that can haul hundreds of pounds, maintain and repair bicycles, and convert bikes to electric assist for extended range and heavy loads.

### Why This Matters

Transportation is often overlooked in resilience planning, but it's essential. The ability to move yourself and cargo without relying on gasoline or functioning roads provides flexibility in any situation. Bicycles and human-powered transport are also healthier, cheaper, and more sustainable than car-dependent alternatives.
