## Water: How do we collect, store, and purify water?

Water is life. When municipal systems fail or wells run dry, how do you ensure safe drinking water for your household? How do you collect rain, filter contaminants, and store water safely?

Our water workshops teach practical skills for water independence—from simple rainwater collection systems to biochar filtration that can remove pesticides and other contaminants. You'll learn to test water quality, build treatment systems, and design storage appropriate for your needs.

### Why This Matters

Access to clean water is the most fundamental resilience need. Even short-term disruptions to water supply create serious problems. Understanding how to collect, store, and purify water gives you options when infrastructure fails—and can reduce your ongoing water costs and environmental impact.

### Learning Pathway

**Intro** → Rainwater Capture basics
**Applied** → Biochar Water Filtration
**Future** → Water Level Monitoring, Hand Pumps

### Current Workshops

- [Off-Grid Water Monitoring](/workshops/off-grid-water-monitoring/) - Monitor water levels and quality using low-power sensors

### Coming Soon

- Biochar Water Filtration - Build household and community-scale filtration systems
