## Communication: How do we stay connected off-grid?

When the internet goes down or cell towers fail, how do you reach your neighbors? Your family across town? Emergency services?

Our communication workshops teach you to build and operate independent radio networks—mesh systems that work without infrastructure, license-free options for local coordination, and amateur radio for long-distance resilience. You'll leave with working hardware and the knowledge to deploy it.

### Why This Matters

Communication is the nervous system of community resilience. During emergencies, cell networks become overloaded or fail entirely. Having alternative communication methods—and knowing how to use them—can be the difference between isolation and coordination. These skills also open up fascinating technical territory, from software-defined radio to satellite communication.

### Learning Pathway

**Intro** → Easy Off-Grid Mesh Radio (Meshtastic)
**Applied** → Off-Grid Telemetry
**Advanced** → Building a DIY 4G Phone
