## Food: How do we grow, preserve, and cook food?

Where does your food come from? How would you eat if supply chains broke down? What skills do you need to grow, preserve, and prepare food independently?

Our food workshops cover the full cycle—from soil to table. Learn to grow food in small spaces, extend your growing season, preserve harvests through fermentation and dehydration, and cook with minimal energy using rocket stoves and solar cookers.

### Why This Matters

Food security is about more than stockpiling—it's about skills. Knowing how to grow even a portion of your food, extend the season with cold frames, and preserve the harvest gives you resilience that no amount of stored food can match. These are skills that connect you to your land and community.

### Learning Pathway
