## Energy: How do we generate and store power?

When the grid goes down, where does your power come from? How do you keep the lights on, charge your devices, or run essential equipment?

Our energy workshops teach you to build and maintain independent power systems—from small solar setups that can charge phones and run lights, to more complex off-grid monitoring systems. You'll leave understanding the fundamentals of electricity, batteries, and renewable generation, with hands-on experience building systems you can replicate at home.

### Why This Matters

Energy independence is foundational to resilience. Even a small solar system can keep communications running during an outage. Understanding how electricity works—and how to generate and store it safely—opens up possibilities for everything from emergency preparedness to reducing your reliance on centralized infrastructure.
