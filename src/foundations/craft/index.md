## Arts & Crafts: How do we create and express?

Creativity and hands-on making are essential to resilient living. Our arts and crafts workshops teach techniques for creating beautiful, functional objects while developing patience, dexterity, and artistic vision.

### Why This Matters

Making things by hand connects us to materials and processes in ways that mass production cannot. These skills provide creative outlets, produce unique functional items, and preserve traditional crafts.
