## Climate: How do we heat, cool, and condition air?

How do you stay warm when the power's out? Cool when it's 100 degrees? How do you maintain healthy air quality indoors?

Our climate workshops teach low-energy approaches to thermal comfort and air quality. Build air filtration systems that actually work, monitor CO2 levels to know when to ventilate, and learn heating strategies that don't depend on the grid.

### Why This Matters

Heating and cooling consume enormous amounts of energy—and fail exactly when you need them most, during extreme weather. Understanding passive solar design, thermal mass, and efficient heating lets you stay comfortable with minimal energy. And air quality matters more than most people realize—proper filtration and ventilation can significantly impact health.

### Learning Pathway

**Intro** → DIY Air Filtration (Corsi-Rosenthal box)
**Applied** → DIY CO2 Monitoring
**Advanced** → Heating Small Spaces, Rocket Stoves
**Future** → Passive Cooling
