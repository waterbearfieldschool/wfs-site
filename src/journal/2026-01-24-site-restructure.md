We've just completed a major restructure of the Waterbear Field School website to better showcase our ongoing work.

## What's New

The site now features four main sections:

- **Workshops** - Our current workshop offerings
- **Recently** - Past workshops and events
- **Projects** - Ongoing research and development projects
- **Foundations** - Our curriculum framework covering essential resilience systems

## New Projects Section

The Projects section now includes external projects from Edge Collective, including:

- **UV254 Spectrophotometer** - Building low-cost instruments for water quality testing
- **Water Storage Monitoring** - Satellite-based monitoring for remote ranch tanks
- **Biochar Water Filters** - DIY water filtration using locally-produced biochar
- **Crate Carts** - Low-cost carts for small farms
- **CO2 Ventilation Assessment** - Using CO2 monitors for indoor air quality
- **DIY Air Purifiers** - The Corsi-Rosenthal box design
- **Flood Sensing** - DIY flood alert systems

Each project is tagged with its associated foundation (Water, Air, Transport, etc.) using our color-coded system.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue developing new workshops and projects!
