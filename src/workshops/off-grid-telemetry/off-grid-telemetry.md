## Off-Grid Monitoring Workshop

Learn to build solar-powered environmental monitoring systems that collect and transmit sensor data from remote locations without grid power or internet infrastructure. These systems use LoRa radio technology to send measurements over long distances to a central gateway for visualization and analysis.

### What You'll Learn

- **Sensor integration** - Connecting temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and voltage sensors to microcontrollers
- **LoRa communication** - Transmitting data wirelessly over several miles without cellular or WiFi
- **Solar power systems** - Sizing panels and batteries for continuous off-grid operation
- **Low-power design** - Programming sleep cycles to extend battery life through minimal sunlight periods
- **Data visualization** - Setting up dashboards to monitor and graph incoming telemetry

### System Components

- **Remote sensor node** - Microcontroller with attached sensors, solar panel, and battery
- **LoRa radio module** - Long-range wireless transmitter for sending data
- **Gateway** - Receives radio transmissions and relays data to a server
- **Monitoring dashboard** - Web interface for viewing real-time and historical data

### Applications

- **Farm monitoring** - Track soil moisture and temperature across fields and greenhouses
- **Weather stations** - Collect ambient temperature, humidity, and pressure readings
- **Water systems** - Monitor well levels, tank volumes, and stream conditions
- **Battery health** - Track solar charging effectiveness and voltage levels over time

### Workshop Details

Perfect for farmers, gardeners, land managers, and anyone interested in remote environmental monitoring. No prior electronics experience necessary - we'll cover everything from wiring sensors to viewing your data online.

### Register

Registration opens late January 2026.
