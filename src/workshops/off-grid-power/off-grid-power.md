Learn to generate, store, and use electrical energy without the grid!

This workshop meets once per session. Please check the schedule above for upcoming dates. By registering, you are committing to attend the full session.

### Instructors

**Mike Beach** is an Electrical Engineer with experience designing and debugging electro-optical and analog systems. He has held low-noise analog design classes for IEEE, co-taught a robotic design course based on a hybrid Raspberry Pi/Arduino platform at Artisan's Asylum, and is an active participant and mentor at Circuit Hacking night held at the Asylum every Wednesday.

**Don Blair** is a researcher, educator, and tinkerer with a background in physics and environmental monitoring. He has built off-grid solar systems for remote sensing applications and enjoys exploring low-cost, accessible approaches to energy independence.

### Class Description

In this hands-on workshop, we'll explore practical approaches to small-scale electrical power generation and storage. We'll start by assessing typical household electrical needs and discussing how to power essential devices during grid outages. From there, we'll dive into battery storage options, solar panel basics, and human-powered alternatives like bicycle generators.

Students will get hands-on experience with small-scale solar power systems, inverters, and battery setups. We'll also build and test gravity-based lighting solutions and learn to use multimeters for measuring voltage and current. By the end of the session, participants will take home a DIY multimeter and a gravity light or crank light they've assembled themselves.

This workshop is intended for everyone—from complete beginners to folks with some electrical experience looking to expand their skills.

### Material Fee

The materials fee for this class is $15. This covers components for the take-home projects (DIY multimeter and gravity/crank light). This will be paid directly to the instructor at the start of class. Cash or Venmo accepted.

### Class Goals

- Assess electrical needs for powering devices without grid access
- Understand battery storage options and affordable solutions
- Learn generation methods: solar panels, pedal-power, and wind
- Use multimeters to measure voltage and current
- Build and test small-scale solar systems with battery storage
- Assemble a human-powered bicycle generator
- Construct gravity-based and crank-powered lighting

### Materials Supplied

Solar panels, charge controllers, batteries, inverters, multimeter kits, LED components, gravity light materials, and bicycle generator components.

### Students Should Bring

Comfortable clothes you don't mind getting a bit dirty. Closed-toe shoes recommended.

### Prerequisites

None! This class is designed for kids and adults alike—no prior experience necessary.

### Additional Resources

Participants will gain access to live monitoring data from a residential solar installation and opportunities to contribute to community solar charging infrastructure projects.

### Register

Registration opens late January 2026.
