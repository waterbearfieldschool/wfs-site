## Off-Grid Mesh Radio Workshop

Learn to build and deploy LoRa mesh radio networks that work without internet or cell service. These low-power devices communicate over miles of range, automatically relaying messages through the network to extend coverage across farms, forests, and neighborhoods.

### What You'll Learn

- **Hardware setup** - Working with affordable microcontrollers like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico
- **Firmware flashing** - Installing and updating mesh radio software on your devices
- **Network configuration** - Setting up channels, encryption, and multi-device networks
- **Sensor integration** - Connecting environmental sensors and sending data over the mesh
- **Custom functionality** - Building modules for your specific monitoring needs

### Applications

- **Farm monitoring** - Track soil moisture, weather stations, and livestock across large properties without cellular coverage
- **Grid-down communications** - Maintain text messaging and location sharing when power and internet are unavailable
- **Remote sensing** - Monitor water levels, temperature, and other conditions in areas without infrastructure
- **Asset tracking** - Keep tabs on equipment, vehicles, or animals across wide areas
- **Community networks** - Build neighborhood communication systems independent of commercial infrastructure

### How It Works

LoRa (Long Range) radio technology enables communication over several miles using minimal power. When multiple devices form a mesh network, messages automatically hop from node to node, extending range far beyond what a single radio could achieve. Each device can act as both an endpoint and a relay.

### Workshop Details

Perfect for farmers, homesteaders, emergency preparedness enthusiasts, and anyone interested in resilient communications. No prior radio or electronics experience necessary - we'll start from the basics and have you sending messages by the end of the session.

### Register

Registration opens late January 2026.
