## Local, inexpensive, DIY radio networking that doesn't rely on cellular or internet infrastructure

Most modern communication depends on distant infrastructure we rarely see and can't access. Mesh radio flips that model.

This winter lunchtime workshop is a compact, hands-on introduction to decentralized radio communication, held outdoors during the warmest part of the day. In a small group setting (max 6 participants), we'll use real radios to build a simple mesh network, and watch how messages move from device to device. We'll learn the basics of setting up repeaters in useful locations, enabling participants to begin to develop resilient, secure communications networks in their own neighborhoods (and beyond).

## Background

Recently developed, open source radio projects now allow people to communicate over several miles, with minimal power, using low-cost hardware that doesn't require a special license. When multiple devices form a mesh network, messages automatically hop from node to node, extending range far beyond what a single radio could achieve. Many people are now using these radio technologies to develop resilient local networks that continue to operate even when the cellular network, internet, or grid are down or unavailable.

### What We'll Explore

- What mesh radio is and how it differs from cellular and Wi-Fi
- How messages hop between radios in a mesh network
- The role of antennas, placement, and terrain
- Working with affordable hardware
- Real-world use cases: farms, neighborhoods, events, field work, and protests

### Applications

- **Farm monitoring** - Track conditions across large properties without cellular coverage
- **Grid-down communications** - Maintain text messaging when power and internet are unavailable
- **Remote sensing** - Monitor water levels, temperature, and other conditions in areas without infrastructure
- **Community networks** - Build neighborhood communication systems independent of commercial infrastructure

### You'll Leave With

- A clear mental model of how mesh networks function
- Experience sending messages across a live mesh
- Practical insight into deploying radios in the field
- Better questions about range, reliability, and power

### Workshop Details

- **When:** Winter lunchtime (11:30 AM – 1:00 PM or 12:00 – 1:30 PM)
- **Where:** Outdoors in Greater Boston, MA
- **Duration:** ~90 minutes
- **Group size:** Limited to 6 participants
- **Cost:** $45 | $65 | $85 (Sliding scale)
- **Equipment:** Radios provided for use during the workshop (also available for purchase)

### What to Bring

- Warm layers
- Gloves that allow dexterity
- A charged phone (for radio pairing, if applicable)
- A mug with a warm drink (encouraged)

### Who This Is For

Curious beginners, farmers, organizers, educators, outdoor workers—anyone interested in resilient or off-grid communication. No technical background or prior radio experience required.

### How This Connects

Off-grid power and mesh radio are deeply connected systems. Radios need energy to function, and the way that energy is generated, stored, and managed shapes how reliable a radio network can be. If you're curious about powering radios and designing reliable solar-powered repeaters, see our [Winter Lunchtime Off-Grid Power workshop](/workshops/off-grid-power/).

Registration opens late January 2026.
