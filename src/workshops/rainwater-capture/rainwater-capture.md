## Rainwater Capture Workshop

Learn to design and build effective rainwater collection systems for household and garden use. This workshop covers the fundamentals of harvesting rain from rooftops, calculating potential yield, and building reliable storage and distribution systems.

### What You'll Learn

- **Catchment calculation** - Estimating rainfall potential from your roof area
- **First-flush diverters** - Keeping debris and contaminants out of your storage
- **Storage options** - From rain barrels to larger cistern systems
- **Distribution systems** - Gravity-fed and pumped options for gardens and household use
- **Filtration basics** - When and how to treat collected rainwater
- **Legal considerations** - Understanding rainwater harvesting regulations in your area

### Why Rainwater?

Rainwater collection reduces dependence on municipal water supplies, cuts costs, and provides a backup water source during droughts or infrastructure failures. Even modest rooftop catchment can provide significant water for irrigation, and with proper treatment, for household use.

### Workshop Details

This introductory workshop covers system design principles through a hands-on build of a first-flush diverter and rain barrel setup. Participants will leave with the knowledge to design and install systems appropriate for their own homes.

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Materials included:** First-flush diverter kit, connections
**Take home:** Your completed diverter assembly and design calculations
