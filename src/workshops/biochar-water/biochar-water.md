## Biochar Water Filter Workshop

*Image: [Kearns et al, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468312423000184)*

Learn to build decentralized water filtration systems using biochar - a carbon material that can be produced locally from agricultural waste. These filters use adsorption to remove contaminants, offering a sustainable alternative to commercial activated carbon filters.

### What You'll Learn

- How biochar filtration works through adsorption
- Producing biochar from biomass using simple equipment
- Assembling multi-stage filtration systems
- Sizing filters for household or community use

### Workshop Details

Ideal for anyone interested in water resilience, off-grid living, or community preparedness. Biochar filters can process 300-2000+ liters daily depending on design, using materials that can be sourced and produced locally.
