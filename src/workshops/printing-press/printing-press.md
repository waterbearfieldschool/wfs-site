## DIY Printing Press Workshop

Explore the art of relief printing by creating your own printing blocks and pressing custom designs onto paper. This hands-on workshop connects traditional craft techniques with creative expression.

### What You'll Learn

- Carving techniques for creating printing blocks from wood or linoleum
- Principles of relief printing and mirror-image design
- Ink application and paper pressing methods
- Creating repeatable prints and patterns

### Workshop Details

Participants will design and carve their own printing blocks, then use them to create prints on paper. We'll cover both simple stamp-style blocks and more intricate designs. You'll leave with your own carved block and a set of prints you've made.

This workshop is suitable for all ages and skill levels—from simple shapes for beginners to detailed carvings for those seeking a challenge.

### Resources

This workshop draws inspiration from the excellent Instructables guide [Build a Letterpress & Use It to Print Things](https://www.instructables.com/Build-a-Letterpress-Use-It-to-Print-Things/), which demonstrates how to build a functional letterpress from plywood and use photopolymer plates for printing.
