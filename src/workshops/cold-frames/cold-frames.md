Learn to build your own cold frame using reclaimed windows and basic woodworking techniques. Cold frames are simple, unheated structures that extend your growing season by weeks or even months, allowing you to start seedlings earlier in spring and harvest greens later into fall and winter.

### What You'll Learn

- Sourcing and selecting reclaimed windows for cold frame construction
- Testing windows and paint for lead safety
- Basic woodworking techniques using hand tools
- Cold frame design considerations: sizing, orientation, and ventilation
- Season extension strategies for your garden

### Workshop Details

Participants will build the components of a cold frame during the workshop, ready to assemble at home. We'll use inexpensive materials and basic hand tools - no power tools or advanced woodworking experience required.

Cold frames are perfect for starting seedlings, hardening off transplants, and growing cold-hardy greens through the winter months. A well-positioned cold frame can extend your growing season by 4-8 weeks on each end.
