## Off-Grid Water Level Monitoring Workshop

Learn to build and deploy solar-powered water level sensors for remote monitoring of wells, streams, ponds, and storage tanks. These systems operate independently of grid power and cellular infrastructure, making them ideal for rural and off-grid applications.

### What You'll Learn

- **Sensor selection** - Choosing between ultrasonic, pressure, and float-based water level sensors
- **Solar power systems** - Sizing panels and batteries for continuous operation
- **Low-power electronics** - Programming microcontrollers for minimal energy consumption
- **Data transmission** - Options for LoRa radio, cellular, and satellite communication
- **Weatherproofing** - Building enclosures that survive outdoor conditions

### Applications

- Well water level tracking for sustainable groundwater management
- Stream and pond monitoring for flood warning and ecological research
- Cistern and tank level measurement for water storage systems
- Wetland monitoring for conservation and restoration projects

### Components

- **Ultrasonic or pressure sensors** - Non-contact or submersible water level detection
- **ESP32 or Arduino** - Low-power programmable microcontrollers
- **Solar panel and battery** - Off-grid power with charge controller
- **LoRa radio module** - Long-range wireless data transmission

### Workshop Details

Perfect for farmers, land managers, researchers, and anyone interested in water resource monitoring. No prior electronics experience necessary.
