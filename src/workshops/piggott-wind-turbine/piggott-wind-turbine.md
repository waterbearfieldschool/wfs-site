*A small-scale wind turbine based on Hugh Piggott's open-source design.*

## Piggott Wind Turbine Workshop

Build a complete small-scale wind turbine based on Hugh Piggott's renowned open-source design, created specifically for ease of fabrication, good output in moderate winds, and resistance to strong winds. These turbines range from 1.2m to 4.2m in diameter, producing 200-2000W of electricity.

### What You'll Learn

- **Woodworking**: Sculpting rotor blades with aircraft wing profiles
- **Mechanics**: Building the nacelle, masts, and using wheel hubs as rotation axes
- **Electrical**: Fabricating the disc-shaped generator and wiring connections
- **Resin work**: Casting and finishing generator components
- Theory of electricity, aerodynamics, and wind power mechanics

### Workshop Details

This intensive workshop uses rotating stations so participants experience every aspect of wind turbine construction. You'll work on blade carving, mechanical assembly, and electrical fabrication throughout the workshop.

Theory sessions complement the hands-on work, covering the physics of wind power, electrical generation, and system integration for off-grid applications.

Suitable for both beginners and experienced builders. The Piggott design has been built by thousands of people worldwide and is well-documented for continued learning after the workshop.
