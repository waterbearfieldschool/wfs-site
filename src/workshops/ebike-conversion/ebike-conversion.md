## E-Bike Conversion Workshop

Transform your regular bicycle into an electric-assisted bike (e-bike) by installing an electrification kit. This hands-on workshop covers the complete process from understanding e-bike components to diagnosing common issues, giving you the skills to electrify bikes and maintain them long-term.

### What You'll Learn

- How e-bike motors work: hub motors vs. mid-drive systems
- Battery technology: types, capacity measurement, and care
- Controllers and sensors: how they communicate
- E-bike regulations and legal considerations
- Installing electrification kits on different bike frames
- Diagnosing faults in e-bike electrical systems
- Assessing and reconditioning used batteries
- Regenerative braking technology

### Workshop Details

Participants will work hands-on with e-bike components and have the opportunity to test bikes with different motor types and power levels. We'll cover both the theory behind electric propulsion and practical installation techniques.

This workshop is suitable for anyone comfortable with basic bicycle mechanics. No prior electrical experience required.
