*Building creative structures from cardboard using simple tools.*

## Cardboard Fabrication Workshop

Learn to transform cardboard into sturdy, creative structures using a nibbler tool, plastic fasteners, and simple cutting techniques—all completely safe for kids while still engaging for adults.

### What You'll Learn

- Operating a nibbler—a drill attachment that works like a mini table saw but is completely safe with cardboard
- Using plastic fasteners and cutting tools for clean, precise construction
- Design principles for building durable cardboard structures
- Powering tools directly from a battery or solar panel

### Workshop Details

The nibbler is operated by a foot pedal, making it easy and safe to use. We'll set up outdoors in a park setting where participants of all ages can design and build their own creations. We'll have interesting design templates for both kids and adults, plus encourage original designs.

This workshop demonstrates how simple, low-power tools can enable creative fabrication anywhere—no outlet required.
