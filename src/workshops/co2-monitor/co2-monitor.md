## DIY CO2 Monitoring Workshop

Build your own inexpensive, open-source CO2 monitor for indoor air quality assessment. Indoor CO2 levels serve as a practical indicator of ventilation effectiveness and potential airborne disease transmission risk.

### Why CO2 Monitoring Matters

Higher CO2 concentrations suggest poor air circulation and increased exposure to airborne pathogens. Schools, offices, and public spaces benefit from monitoring to optimize ventilation and ensure occupant safety.

### What You'll Learn

- **Sensor basics** - Working with the Sensirion SCD30 CO2 module
- **Microcontroller programming** - Using ESP32 or similar boards
- **Data logging** - Storing readings to microSD cards
- **Display options** - OLED screens for real-time readings
- **Calibration techniques** - Ensuring accurate measurements

### Key Features

- Real-time CO2 concentration display
- Local data storage with graphing capability
- Optional WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring
- Battery-powered operation for flexible deployment
- Air-change-rate (ACH) calculation through decay analysis

### Workshop Details

Perfect for anyone interested in indoor air quality, electronics, or environmental monitoring. No prior experience necessary - we'll guide you through assembly and programming.
