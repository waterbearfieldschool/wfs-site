## Cob Oven Workshop

*Image: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_oven)*

Learn to build your own outdoor clay oven using cob - a mixture of clay, sand, and straw that has been used for thousands of years. These wood-fired ovens have been used since 4,000 BC for baking bread and cooking, and continue to be built around the world today.

### What You'll Learn

- Cob mixing and preparation techniques
- Building the foundation and firebrick floor
- Shaping the dome for optimal heat retention
- The science of thermal mass and radiant heat cooking
- Firing and curing your oven

### How Cob Ovens Work

The dome-shaped oven absorbs heat from a wood fire, storing it in the dense clay walls. When hot, the heavy walls release heat slowly for hours, cooking food with both hot air and radiant heat. The enclosed space also seals in steam, producing flavorful, chewy crusts on bread and pizza.

### Workshop Details

Perfect for anyone interested in outdoor cooking, sustainable building, or traditional crafts. Build an oven that can bake bread, pizza, roasts, and more using techniques passed down through millennia.
