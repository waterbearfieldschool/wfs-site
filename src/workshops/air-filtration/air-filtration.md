## DIY Air Filtration Workshop

Learn to build your own affordable, effective air purifier. We'll explore several designs, including the well-known Corsi-Rosenthal-Comparetto box - a collaborative open-source design that costs less than $200 and requires no specialized tools.

### How It Works

The basic design uses four MERV-13 filters forming the sides of a box, with a box fan on top and cardboard as the base. Air flows in through the filter sides, removing particulates, and exits through the fan at the top. MERV-13 filters remove approximately 85% of viral-laden particulates.

### What You'll Learn

- **Understanding MERV ratings** - How different filter ratings affect particle removal
- **Sizing for your space** - Calculating air changes per hour (ACH) for your room
- **Building techniques** - Assembling effective, durable filter boxes
- **Design variations** - Choosing from multiple configurations with varying filter quantities and airflow

### Performance

These devices deliver approximately 600 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of filtered air. For a typical 20'×20'×10' room, one unit adds about 3 air changes per hour; two units provide 6 ACH - matching Harvard School of Public Health's recommended minimum for COVID-19 mitigation.

### Workshop Details

Perfect for anyone interested in improving indoor air quality at home, school, or workplace. No specialized tools or prior experience required.
